\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Building the matrix}
Since we treat retweet data as an undirected graph, the matrix should be symmetric.

\begin{minted}
[
frame=lines
]
{python}
for row in data:
  matrix[row[0] - 1, row[1] - 1] = 1
  matrix[row[1] - 1, row[0] - 1] = 1
\end{minted}

\section{Experiment}

To run the code: \texttt{python assignment3.py -k 5}. Here, \texttt{-k} is the number of clusters to form.

Evaluation is conducted by observing differences in performance of both metrics by clustering quality on different choice of k.

\begin{table}[tbh]
  \center
  \footnotesize
  \begin{tabular}{l|c}
     & \textbf{running time} \\
    \hline
    two-step (k = 5) & 5.7s \\
    \hline
    linear scan & 1.3s
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
