\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Building the matrix}
Since we treat retweet data as an undirected graph, the matrix should be symmetric.

\begin{minted}
[
frame=lines
]
{python}
for row in data:
  matrix[row[0] - 1, row[1] - 1] = 1
  matrix[row[1] - 1, row[0] - 1] = 1
\end{minted}

\subsection{Personal page-rank}
PPR-based proximity vector for node u is defined as follows: $p_{u} = (1 - \alpha)Ap_{u} + \alpha e_{u}$. By setting $p^{(0)}_{u} = \mathbf{0}$, $p_u$ is computed iteratively.

Note: The value of $p_u$ is independent of $p^{(0)}_{u}$.

\section{Experiment}

To run the code: \texttt{python assignment3.py -k 5}. Here, \texttt{-k} is the number of clusters to form.

\begin{table}[tbh]
  \center
  \footnotesize
  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c}
     & Purity & Entropy & Normalized mutual information (NMI) \\
    \hline
    k = 5 & 11 & 11 & 11 \\
    \hline
    k = 10 & 11 & 11 & 11 \\
    \hline
    k = 15 & 11 & 11 & 11 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
